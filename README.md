# kanav-task8

In this I have used bootstarp in which I used its links and then used the navbar for making navigation and nav-link to add the links 

for the cardholder I used row and column classes with gap 4 and then imported the images into the card placeholder

for footer used the footer class and added the links of my social media handles
